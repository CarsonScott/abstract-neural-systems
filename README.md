# Abstract Neural Systems Theory

## Systems and Trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A system transforms an input to an output through a collection of interconnected operators and storage units. A system is considered active when it produces an output. The output is sent to a tree which carries it to inputs of other system. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tree grows connections when it receives an output signal. A connection of a tree is also a tree, meaning that it too can grow connections. A connection is strengthened when it receives an output signal and especially when it activates a connected system. A connection is weakened when it fails to activate a connected system. Connections are dropped when they become significantly weaker than the rest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following system receives three inputs which are sent between two operators in which the second incorporates a stored variable. The output is passed to a tree with five branches.

## Generating systems 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following image shows the collection of possible components that make up each system. The number of lines to the left of each component correlates with the number of inputs required to function. By column, the components are in arranged by interfaces, algebraic operators, logistic operators, conditional operators, and storage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A system begins with a single operator. The number of inputs is random and determines the number of storage units. For example, a system with a summation operator and only one input gains a storage unit because the summation operator takes 2 or more inputs to produce an output.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the base structure is initialized, the system gains operators between the original operator and the input to ensure that the system has a single output. This forms chains of operators and storage units until each input connects to a component. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Online development is a byproduct of the interactions between systems. The activity experienced by a system decreases its chances of structural change, allowing successful structures to take hold and remain functional, while unsuccessful systems adapt in order to find working structures. If the activity of a system rapidly decreases following a development, the new component is removed to restore functioning.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A single-use input provides a value to a storage unit and disappears immediately after. This causes a system to reflect initial conditions of its environment. Variables created online will receive values in this way, only they reflect their initial conditions and not the systems. The subsumption of components helps minimize disruptive effects when something new is added.

## System of systems
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As each system develops, so does the collective system as a whole. The network evolves locally from changing connections and functionality, which leads to global change in behavior. Such evolution causes modulation and specialization, which solidifies the different domains of processing. Each area of connected systems develops "cultural" attributes that are unique to them. Connections between modules provide a rich variety of complex processing strategies. The collective behavior reflects the complexity of individuals, which ultimately provides insight into the benefits of genetic patterns that determined its structure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An interface to the environment allows the expression of systems structural and functional attributes, and displays the intellectual and resourceful capabilities of a system. A systems performance can be measured from a specific task and compared to other systems, and dominant genetic factors that produce intelligent functions can be extracted, altered, and tested.
